# Models: Introduction

Payoora comes with `Payment` and `Subscription` models, which are required to store PayHere payments and subscriptions.

However, these models alone are not sufficient to start accepting payments. Therefore, Payoora also requires the following models:

- [User](user-model.md)
- [Order](order-model.md)
- [OrderLine](order-line-model.md)

> [!NOTE]
> These models may already exist in your application or will need to be created if they don't exist yet.
